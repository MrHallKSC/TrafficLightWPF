    APP.XAML - Application Definition
    ============================================================================

    FOR STUDENTS:
    This file defines the application itself. Think of it as the "entry point"
    configuration for your WPF app.

    Key things to notice:
    1. x:Class="TrafficLightWPF.App" - Links this XAML to the App.xaml.cs code file
    2. StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml" - Tells WPF which window to show when the app starts

    In console apps, you have Main() as your entry point.
    In WPF, the App class handles startup, and StartupUri points to your first window.

    You can also define application-wide resources (styles, colours) here,
    but we're keeping it simple for this example.
    ============================================================================
-->
<Application x:Class="TrafficLightWPF.App"
             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml">

    <!--
        Application.Resources is where you can define styles and colours
        that apply to the whole app. We're not using it in this basic example,
        but it's good to know it exists!
    -->
    <Application.Resources>
    </Application.Resources>

</Application>
